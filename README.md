## üõ† Examples

### [1. Section Override V2 ](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/override-use-cases-overview)

Overrides allow you to replace native components within sections with custom ones. This maintains the core functionalities of native components while allowing you to adjust their appearance and behavior to suit the needs of your store.

#### Adding more icon options to the Alert component

This example illustrates a common use case for `getOverriddenSection` in FastStore. It focuses on customizing the Headless CMS schema for a section to provide more icon options.

Add more icon options to the `Alert`, allowing editors to choose from a wider selection of icons supported by the `@faststore/ui` [iconography](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/reference-icons#usage) library.

- [‚û°Ô∏è Code Example]()

#### Adding an image to your Alert component

The native Alert section provides an icon prop for customization. It only accepts predefined icons, but you want more control and flexibility over the displayed content. In this example, we'll display a custom image instead.

- [‚û°Ô∏è Code Example]()

### [2. API Extensions](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/api-extensions-overview)

If you need to retrieve data not natively provided by the FastStore API, you can achieve this by extending the FastStore API schema and incorporating new data into the existing queries.

#### Adding Installment Information in the Product Details Page

This example illustrates the case where customers can see installment details (number, value, payment system) directly on the product page.

- [‚û°Ô∏è Code Example]()

#### Adding a contact form to a landing page

This example illustrates how to handle data from a Contact Us form and send it to a third-party API. We will create a Contact Us page with a Contact form.
